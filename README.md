The Scholarship Working Hours Web Application serves as a dynamic platform where scholarship students, organizers, and registrars converge to manage and process scholarship work. This application is designed for scholarship students at Assumption University, who are required to complete 60 working hours per semester. The primary goal of this senior project is to develop a user-friendly website that enables students to effortlessly discover scholarship work opportunities, curated by organizers and officially approved by registrars.
